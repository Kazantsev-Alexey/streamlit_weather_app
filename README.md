This project is built with Streamlit and serves as an interface for analyzing historical weather data.
It lets you upload a dataset, displays some basic descriptive stats, and uses an API token to fetch current weather conditions. 
The app then compares the current temperature with historical data to check if itâ€™s an anomaly.
